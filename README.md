# Metamask4FEAT
Metamask for ATs demo

In this repo there are tests to setup Metamask and enter the Pendle web3 app. signing/approving etc still need to be done manually, because I haven't worked out how to use webdriver with the metamask popup (hopefully fixed soon). The hard coded seed phrase is throwaway.

It might not be simple to build / run this on another machine, so there's a .webm video demo included.

Next, I want to get Metamask to launch in a new tab (instead of a new window) - this would make it easier to automate wallet actions.
